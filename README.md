# TCP Protocol Implementation
This is my implementation of the TCP protocol built using C++. With this program you can reliably send packets between a server and client using acks and congestion control just how the real TCP protocol does it at the transport layer.

**Implementation Details**
Header format: the header consists of 3 uint16_t’s representing sequence number, acknowledgement number, and the receive window size, as well as one char used to represent the type of packet it is. In the Constants.h file, you can see the different types a char can be, including SYN, SYNACK, ACK, FIN; this is a slightly different implementation than having single bits represent these values as flags, but takes up the same amount of space (8 bytes) and leads to the same functionality.

The implementation hits all of the major aspects of TCP. There is initially a three way handshake, on which the final ACK there is piggybacked the name of the file requested by the client. Once the server obtains the packet with this filename, it opens the file and divides it into packets depending on how large it is. Then, depending on the receive window size and congestion window size (whichever is smaller) it begins sending these packets, moving the sender window as the sent packets get ack’d. Using the values given in the project description, the timeout to trigger packet retransmission is 500ms. Fast retransmit is also enabled on the server’s side, which keeps track of duplicate acks sent from the client and retransmits the specific file packet when three are received. I also implemented TCP congestion control via slow start and congestion avoidance. This implementation changes the values of the congestion window and ssthresh similarly to how the actual TCP protocol does it.
